 ## Part 1
 `ChatServer` Code:

 * To write this code I used the lab2 setting with the code that my group made for lab2 "Make the Simplest “Search Engine”" part. This is the code that we had written with my group:

 * Then I gave the above code to the copilot and asked to change it so it fits the lab requirements. And this was the code produced:

 * Afterwards, I changed the first return statement to fit the LabReport2 requirements better:

 * However, the provided code would return Strings like "How are you" as "How+are+you+". So I asked ChatGpt to solve the issue in the code, and it modified this portion of the code:
